Overview
This repository contains code for a basic machine learning suggestion system. The system uses the KNearestNeighbors algorithm to suggest similar items based on input features. This can be adapted for a variety of applications such as product recommendations, user preference predictions, and more.

Features
Simple Data Structure: Uses a simple numpy array for feature representation.
K-Nearest Neighbors: Utilizes the scikit-learn KNN algorithm to find the nearest neighbors.
Extensible: Easily extendable for real-world datasets and use cases.
Requirements
    3.7+
scikit-learn
numpy
You can install the required packages with:

  
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN-Suggestion-Model.git
Navigate into the directory:
  
cd KNN-Suggestion-Model
Install the dependencies:
  
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the suggestion system, you can use the sample code provided in main.py:

   
 
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Sample data for the suggestion system
data = np.array([
    [5, 3, 0],  # Item 1
    [1, 1, 0],  # Item 2
    [4, 3, 2],  # Item 3
    [3, 2, 4],  # Item 4
    [1, 0, 5],  # Item 5
])

# Instantiate and train the model
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2)
model.fit(data)

# Make a suggestion based on input
input_item = [4, 3, 2]
distances, indices = model.kneighbors([input_item])

# Print suggestions
print(f"Suggested items: {indices[0]}")
Example Output:

Suggested items: [2 0]
You can modify the dataset, change the number of neighbors, or integrate it with real-world data.
